# Gogol Jump

This project is a small 2D game in which you control a round character,
in the shape of a multi-colored "**G**", that jumps around on moving platforms, trying to
avoid falling down. Points are obtained over time (when platforms reach the bottom of the screen),
the goal being to reach the highest score possible.


This game is freely inspired by the platformer genre and the game Doodle Jump in particular;
however, though it is a finished project, there lack functionnalities for it to be a truly complete game.


You can download the game for free on https://spacemonkey-mh.itch.io/gogol-jump


The current build uses Godot 4.1.1.stable.
